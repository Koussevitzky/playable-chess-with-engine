# playable-chess-with-engine
This project is meant to emulate many of the features available on sites like
lichess.org (but without viewing their source code! No cheating!)


### Interface project goals:
  1. Playable chessboard
     - Only legal moves may be played
     - Flags for castling rights and en passant
     - The previous and new square after a move are highlighted
     - Pawn promotion
  2. Move history is displayed with algebraic notation
  3. Different "board themes" are available to be selected
  4. Integration of information from the Chess Openings section of Wikibooks
     - Show the opening name and notes given from the webpage
  5. Recognize whether the game is over (checkmate or stalemate)
  
  
### AI project goals:
  1. Only suggests/plays legal moves
  2. Explore and try to understand different AI Chess Algorithms
     - Min-max searching
     - Alpha-beta pruning

### Possible Future Additions
  1. Drawable arrows and highlighting of any square
     - Potentially with multiple colors depending on Shift, Alt, or Ctrl
  2. Multiple levels of difficulty for the computer opponent
  3. Store previous games played
  4. Play from a position that the user sets up
